				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p> This project takes an existing image and then creates a new image out of it. There is a slider that will change the mutation rate on the image so with 100 being the highest mutation and 1 being the lowest.
					Once the program generates new images, it will display them below.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> The program has a drop down menu with all the images from the assets folder. Then when the user clicks on one of them, it creates a set of parameters for that image such as x,y coordiates and color of those certian coordinates.
					Then it goes through a drawing function that will then draw the image with the parameters given. Then it will go through a mutation function that alters the existing shapes. 
					The intensity of the mutation is dependent on the mutation slider as higher numbers will up the intensity and lower numbers will lower the intensity.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> This assignment was a lot less tedious and frustrating than some of the other experiments. It was hard to understand what the instructions meant at first but the example really helped a lot with that. I had most of it down pretty quickly
					but I didn't really know how to make the shapes actually correlate with the image so it was just a bunch of random circles that didn't look like the original image. ChatGPT helped a lot with this issue as it showed me the map function, allowing me to map
					colors and pixels with certain coordiantes. After that it was a lot of changing of parameters until I got what I wanted. Overall I think I did a decent job especially adding the colors and opacity and I had some fun doing it as well.
