				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this assignment, we are creating tile based generative worlds. We must make 1 outdoor world and 1 dungeon world with signs of life being implemented in both.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The system runs on many functions but mainly, a grid is created using symbols such as '_' and ','. Based on which symbol is on the grid and what it is surrounded by, the program shows a small image that is from a tile based image.
					It does this by using a coordinate system for the image to decide what it shows. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This assignment ended up being very difficult for me, even more so than the last one. At times I felt completely lost, and ChatGPT couldn't even save me most of the time (probably because I didn't really understand fully what I was doing).
					At first it was just difficult for me to understand what was being asked of me with functions like the gridCode, and gridContext. Once I got past that though, it wasn't really smooth sailing
					because I just kept running into roadblocks trying to implement a certain feature. Several times, the solution was just something very simple like moving the placements of the declaration of variables, but it took me hours to get to that point.
