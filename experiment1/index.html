				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Creating a text generator out of a template on glitch.com. This generator creates crazy planets that changes attributes such as landscape, wildlife, and name of the planet</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The template had the coding for the generator completed, while I created a new story and filler words for that story.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>It took a while before I was able to think of the generator idea I came up with. I just kept thinking of different things I'm interested until I got to space
					Then I thought of mad libs and making funny words fit into the story so I thought of making a made up distant planet that's completely absurd. Thinking of the
					scenario was fun and I did not get it right on the first try because of some typos.
